# onion_clustering
Code for unsupervised clustering of time-series data. Reference to https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2403771121 for further details. 

Author: Matteo Becchi

## Developement history
This version of onion clustering is meant to be used as an external library, and complies with the scikit-learn format. If you are looking for the standalone onion clustering version, you can find it at https://github.com/matteobecchi/timeseries_analysis. However, be aware that the standalone version has been last updated on September, 2024 and is no longer supported or mantained. We reccomand using this version. 

## Usage
Install the package using ???. 

The `examples/` folder contains an example of usage. From this folder, download the example files as reported in the script `example_script_uni.py` and then run it with `python3 example_script_uni.py`. 

## Dependencies
- [numpy](https://numpy.org)
- [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Aknowledgements
We developed this code when working in the Pavan group, https://www.gmpavanlab.com/. Thanks to Andrew Tarzia for all the help with the code formatting and documentation, and to Domiziano Doria, Chiara Lionello and Simone Martino for the beta-testing. 

The work was funded by the European Union and ERC under projects DYNAPOL and the NextGenerationEU project, CAGEX.
